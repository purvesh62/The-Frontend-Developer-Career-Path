        <h1>The CSS Box Model</h1>
        <p>We can declare widths and heights on elements to define their size. We also have other properties like
            margins, padding, and borders which make up the box model.</p>
        <h2>Margin</h2>
        <p>Margin is used to control the space around an element.</p>
        <h2>Padding</h2>
        <p>Padding is a lot like margin, except that it adds the empty space <em>inside</em> the element, which includes
            it's background-color.</p>
        <h2>Borders</h2>
        <p>Borders are a line that surrounds an element, similar to a stroke if you are familiar with design software.
